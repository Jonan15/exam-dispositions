* Disposition

** 1) Convex hull


** 2) Line segment intersection

** 3) Triangulation
 - Intro: Art gallery guarding
 - Algorithm
   - y-monotone polygons
   - Triangulation
   - Dual graph/Camera placement

** 4) Randomized linear programming
 - Intro: Molding, simplex vs. 2D linear programming
 - Proof: Incrementally adding constraints is correct, 2 cases
 - Proof: 2D randomized LP is expected O(n)

** 5) Kd-trees

** 6) Range-trees

** 7) Point location via trapezoidal maps
 - Intro: why do we want point location?
 - Algorithm
 - Query time
 - Space complexity
 - Construction time

** 8) Voronoi diagrams
 - Intro: The post office problem. One definition = intersection of halfplanes
 - Short proof: Size of Voronoi diagram is linear in size of the point set
 - Solution idea: sweepline
   - Beachline
   - Site events and circle events is sufficient
- Algorithm
- Construction time and space complexity
